/*!
Returns the last system error code.

On Windows this function returns the result of GetLastError. On POSIX platforms
this function returns the value of errno. The value is not stored so other
functions that modify the results of GetLastError or errno should not be
called if you want to retrieve the last system error that occurred in one of
reproc's functions.

On POSIX, if an error occurs after fork but before exec it is communicated to
the parent process which sets its own errno value to the errno value of the
child process. This makes it possible to retrieve errors that happen after
forking with this function (for example in chdir or execve).
